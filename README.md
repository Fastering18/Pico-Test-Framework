# Pico-Test-Framework
Public testing Pico.V framework performance
<br>
After deploying to heroku and do the test, they are faster a little bit.  
pico.v is hard to do routing, the endpoint served under file name unlike flask that can configure the routings manually  

Reponse average time: **20ms** based on how endpoint serve the data to return  
Server: **uwsgi**  
Host: **Heroku**
